# 🌐 How Subdomains Work for ain90.online

## ✅ Currently Working:

1. **User creates website** → Subdomain saved in database
2. **Example**: User creates "a" → Stored as subdomain "a"
3. **Shows in dashboard**: `a.ain90.online`

## ❌ NOT Automatically Created:

The subdomain `a.ain90.online` is SAVED in database but:
- **DNS not configured** automatically
- **Vercel not set up** for subdomains
- **Need manual DNS setup**

---

## 🔧 What You Need to Do:

### **Option 1: Wildcard DNS (RECOMMENDED)**

In GoDaddy DNS, add:

**CNAME Record:**
- Type: CNAME
- Name: *
- Value: `cname.vercel-dns.com` (or Vercel CDN endpoint)

**What this does:**
- Makes ALL subdomains work automatically
- User creates "a" → `a.ain90.online` works
- User creates "mysite" → `mysite.ain90.online` works

---

### **Option 2: Manual DNS per Subdomain**

Every time a user creates a website, you add DNS:
- Go to GoDaddy
- Add CNAME: `subdomain-name` → Vercel

**Problem**: Too much work!

---

## ✅ Recommended Setup:

**Go to GoDaddy → DNS:**

Add this ONE record:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: *
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
TTL: 600
```

**Then:**
1. User creates website with subdomain "a"
2. URL automatically works: `a.ain90.online`
3. Website loads!

---

**Without DNS**: Subdomain shows in dashboard but doesn't load in browser.

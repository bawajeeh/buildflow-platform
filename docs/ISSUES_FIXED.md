# Critical Issues Found and Fixed

Based on comprehensive audit of USER_JOURNEY.md flow.

## 🔴 Critical Issues Found

### 1. **Publishing Endpoint Mismatch** ❌
**Issue**: Frontend calls `/api/websites/:id/publish` but backend only has `/api/publish/website/:websiteId`
- Frontend: `POST /api/websites/${id}/publish` (in `useWebsiteStore.publishWebsite()`)
- Backend: `POST /api/publish/website/:websiteId` (in `routes/publish.ts`)
- **Impact**: Publishing fails with 404 error

**Fix**: Added route handler in `backend/src/routes/websites.ts` to handle both endpoints

---

### 2. **Subdomain Not Auto-Generated** ⚠️
**Issue**: Subdomain must be manually entered, but should auto-generate from website name
- Frontend auto-generates slug but requires user input
- Backend doesn't validate subdomain uniqueness
- No automatic domain setup

**Fix**: 
- Improved auto-generation in `CreateWebsiteModal`
- Added subdomain uniqueness check in backend
- Added automatic `.ain90.online` domain format

---

### 3. **White Screen Risks** ❌
**Issues**:
- `sortedElements` in BuilderCanvas could be undefined when `page` is null
- `currentPage?.elements` accessed without null checks in several places
- Error in useEffect for default page creation could cause crash
- No error boundary around BuilderLayout

**Fixes**:
- Added null safety checks in `BuilderCanvas.tsx`
- Added try-catch in default page creation
- Added fallback empty arrays
- Improved error handling

---

### 4. **Missing Default Homepage Creation** ⚠️
**Issue**: When website is created, no default homepage is automatically created
- User must manually create first page
- Empty website state could cause confusion

**Fix**: Backend automatically creates homepage when website is created

---

### 5. **Page Creation Route Confusion** ⚠️
**Issue**: Two routes for page creation:
- `POST /api/websites/:websiteId/pages` ✅ (used by frontend)
- `POST /api/pages` with `websiteId` in body ❌ (not used)

**Fix**: Clarified and ensured both work correctly

---

### 6. **Missing Error Handling** ⚠️
**Issues**:
- `fetchPages()` throws error but not caught in BuilderLayout
- `createPage()` in useEffect could fail silently
- No error state display for users

**Fixes**:
- Added comprehensive error handling
- Added error state display
- Added loading states

---

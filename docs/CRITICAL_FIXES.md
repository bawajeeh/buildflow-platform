# Critical Fixes Applied - Comprehensive Solution

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: React Error #310 Infinite Loop
**Root Causes:**
1. `renderElement` useCallback has `draggingId` in dependencies - changes during drag
2. `handleDrop` has `zoom`/`freeformMode` in dependencies but uses them directly
3. useEffect at line 41 runs on EVERY render (no dependency array)
4. useEffect at line 437 has state variables in dependencies that change during drag

### Issue 2: CORS/401 for Published Websites
**Root Causes:**
1. Express route order: `/api/websites/subdomain/:subdomain` is mounted AFTER `/api/websites` with auth
2. Express matches `/api/websites` first, so subdomain route never executes
3. Need to mount subdomain route BEFORE the general websites route

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Remove all dependencies that change during drag
- Remove `draggingId` from `renderElement` dependencies
- Use refs for all dynamic values in event handlers
- Fix useEffect dependency arrays

### Fix 2: Express Route Ordering
- Mount specific subdomain route BEFORE general `/api/websites` route
- Ensure no route conflicts

### Fix 3: CORS Dynamic Handler
- Already implemented but verify it works correctly
- Test with actual subdomain requests

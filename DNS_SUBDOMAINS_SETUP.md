# 🔧 DNS Setup for Wildcard Subdomains

## ✅ What Happens Now:

**User creates website:**
1. Fills form: Name = "My Site", Subdomain = "a"
2. Subdomain saved in database: `"a"`
3. Shows in dashboard: `a.ain90.online`
4. **BUT URL doesn't work** - 404 error

---

## 🔧 Fix: Add Wildcard DNS

**Go to GoDaddy DNS:**

Add this record:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: *
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
```

**What this does:**
- Routes ANY subdomain (*) to your Vercel deployment
- `a.ain90.online` → Vercel
- `mysite.ain90.online` → Vercel
- `test.ain90.online` → Vercel

---

## ⚡ After Adding Wildcard DNS:

1. User creates website with subdomain "a"
2. URL: `a.ain90.online` 
3. Works immediately!
4. Website loads

---

## 🎯 Current Status:

✅ **Code**: Fixed (all domains updated to ain90.online)
✅ **Deployed**: Render deploying
⏳ **DNS**: Needs wildcard CNAME
⏳ **Vercel**: Check if VERCEL_CDN needs config

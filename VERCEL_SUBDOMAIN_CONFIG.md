# 🔧 Configure Vercel for Wildcard Subdomains

## The Problem:
You're getting 404 because Vercel doesn't know how to handle `*.ain90.online` subdomains.

## ✅ Solution:

### **Step 1: Vercel Dashboard Configuration**

Go to Vercel → Your Project → Settings → Domains

Add these domains:
1. `ain90.online` ✅ (already added)
2. `www.ain90.online` ✅ (already added)
3. `*.ain90.online` ← **ADD THIS**

### **Step 2: Vercel Will Show DNS Value**

After adding wildcard domain, Vercel shows something like:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: *
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
```

### **Step 3: This Should Match GoDaddy**

Your GoDaddy DNS already has:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: *
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
```

So DNS is correct!

## 🔧 Issue: Vercel Configuration

**The problem**: Vercel needs to be configured to handle wildcard subdomains.

**In Vercel:**
1. Go to your project
2. Settings → Domains
3. Add wildcard: `*.ain90.online`
4. It will verify DNS automatically

## 🎯 After This:

- `ab.ain90.online` works
- `a.ain90.online` works  
- ANY subdomain works!

**The DNS is correct. Just need to add wildcard domain in Vercel dashboard!**
